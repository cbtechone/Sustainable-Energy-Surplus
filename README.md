Buckyball Energy Surplus 
Let's break down your idea of scaling up the buckyball structure with **6-inch solar panels** and estimate how many panels would fit into a **geodesic dome (buckyball)** structure. Then we can calculate the total energy output based on this design.

### 1. **Understanding the Buckyball Structure**:
A **buckyball** (or geodesic dome) is made of hexagons and pentagons, similar to a soccer ball. The number of faces (and thus the number of panels) depends on the level of tessellation or "frequency" of the structure, which determines how many smaller triangles make up each polygonal face.

For simplicity, let’s assume we are using a **standard 60-panel buckyball structure**, which consists of:
   - **12 pentagons** (each made up of 5 triangular panels)
   - **20 hexagons** (each made up of 6 triangular panels)

In total, the **60 panels** are divided as follows:
\[
   12 \, \text{pentagons} \times 5 \, \text{panels per pentagon} + 20 \, \text{hexagons} \times 6 \, \text{panels per hexagon} = 60 \, \text{panels}.
\]

However, this is for a basic tessellation, and we can scale up from here.

### 2. **Scaling Up the Structure**:
If we use **6-inch solar panels**, each triangular panel would have a side length of **6 inches**. The total surface area and the number of panels can be scaled up depending on the overall size of the buckyball.

For a larger, **higher-frequency buckyball**, the number of panels can increase significantly:
- A **higher-frequency buckyball** (with more subdivisions of each pentagon and hexagon face) could easily contain **240 panels** or more.

### 3. **Surface Area Estimation**:
Let’s estimate the **total surface area** of a larger buckyball and use that to calculate how many panels can fit.

- Assume the buckyball has a radius of **1 meter (100 cm)**.
- The surface area of a sphere is:
\[
  \text{Surface Area} = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi \times (100 \, \text{cm})^2 \approx 12,566 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Each 6-inch panel is a triangle with an area of approximately:
\[
\text{Panel Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times (15.24 \, \text{cm})^2 \approx 100.2 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

So, the number of panels that can fit on the surface of the buckyball is:
\[
\frac{12,566 \, \text{cm}^2}{100.2 \, \text{cm}^2} \approx 125 \, \text{panels}.
\]

For larger structures, say a **2-meter radius** buckyball, you would have roughly **500 panels**.

### 4. **Energy Output Calculation**:
Assuming each solar panel generates **0.6 watts** of power (as estimated earlier) and we have **125-500 panels**, the total power output would be:

- For **125 panels**:
\[
  \text{Total Power} = 125 \times 0.6 \, \text{W} = 75 \, \text{W}
\]
- For **500 panels**:
\[
  \text{Total Power} = 500 \times 0.6 \, \text{W} = 300 \, \text{W}
\]

With this level of power output, especially at the higher end, it's more than enough to power a series of **infrared LEDs**, which require around **2 W per LED**.

### 5. **LED Power Consumption**:
Let’s assume you have **10 infrared LEDs**, each consuming **2 W**, which totals:
\[
\text{Total Power Consumption} = 10 \times 2 \, \text{W} = 20 \, \text{W}.
\]

With **75-300 W** being generated by the solar panels alone, your system would have **plenty of surplus energy** for sustaining operation, even accounting for inefficiencies or power losses.

### Conclusion:
- **For a 1-meter buckyball**: You could generate approximately **75 W** of power, easily sustaining the LEDs' power consumption.
- **For a 2-meter buckyball**: You could generate up to **300 W**, which would create a significant energy surplus.

This model shows that your system would likely generate more than enough energy to be **self-sustaining**, with potential surplus energy to store or use for other purposes.
